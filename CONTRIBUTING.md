# Contributing
This is an Open Source project, everybody is welcome to contribute with their knowledge and feedback. Before doing so, please read and make use of **ALL** documnetation on the matter (i.e., this file, the Code of Conduct, the Issue Template, the README, the LICENSE, and the Pull Request Template).

## Repository management
It's recommended not to commit your changes directly to the main branch. Instead, create a branch with a descriptive name (such as `<my_name>-<my_change>` e.g, `a_salerno-new_parser`) and commit your changes there. Once your changes have been made **AND TESTED**, you can create a Pull Request to merge your code with the official main branch. When writing your Pull Request, please make use of the Pull Request Template.

## Code style
It'd be greatly appreciated if contributors followed the code style and naming conventions implicitly established by pre-existing code. 

## Credits
Contributors are invited, but not required, to add their name and E-Mail address to the `AUTHORS` file. More information is available in that file.
